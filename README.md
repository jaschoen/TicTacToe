#Play
To play game, type ruby lib/tictactoe/play.rb from the main directory

#Credit
My implementation of the minmax algorithm was inspired by Mark Phelp's version of tic tac toe, available at https://github.com/markphelps/tictac. 

#Testing
Testing added for everything but the game itself and the minmax algo. I'm still not quite sure what approach to take on those tests since they involve a lot of moving parts (recursion, instance variables, multiple user inputs).  I could mock a full run through, but it would be quite fragile.  For the time being, those parts will have to remain unspeced.
