#Play
To play game, type ruby lib/tictactoe/play.rb from the main directory

#Credit
My implementation of the minmax algorithm was inspired by Mark Phelp's version of this tic tac toe, available at https://github.com/markphelps/tictac. 

#Testing
The more I learn about testing, the more important I believe it to be. However, since I just picked up the RSpec book when I got the coding challenge, I haven't had time to go back and rewrite all the applicable tests.  This is super important and I will be improving this over the next few weeks, along with styling and refactoring. I intend to use TDD/BDD as the foundation for my programming going forward.  This is incredibly important for deployment, but may be be outside the scope of the coding challenge.
